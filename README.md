# calculator-project

Hi,


And welcome to my calculator project. Here I pushed my Javascript/Typescript skills in order to create a functioning calculator.

As you may have noticed, the navbar within the project is called the 'calcul8tor' as the calculating comes later! First, appreciate the futuristic design and the aesthetic model of the buttons.

The functionality of the calculator is one that needs to be developed, however, the calcul8tor is an ever-growing project!

Kind regards,
Tuf
